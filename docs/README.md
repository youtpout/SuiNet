# SuiNet

A dotnet SDK for Sui blockchain

## Client

Actually we integrated the client sdk inpired from the typescript Sdk

If you use a classic .net framework like .Net Framework from 4.6.1 or .Net Core 2.0 you can use directly the SuiNet project.

If you use specific project like Unity or Godot you can use SuiNet.Base and create your own HttpTransport class.
